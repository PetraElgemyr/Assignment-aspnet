# Alpha Project Management System
A fullstack project with MVC designpattern and ASP.NET Core. My first time coding with ASP.NET Core, views and partial views. The design was given to me as an assignment, and the goal was to do as much as I could before a deadline and learning to work with more complex solutions. It was very challenging but fun to learn something that was so different from the front end development that I am used to with React and JavaScript/TypeScript. I got to experience how to use WYSIWYG editors like Quill and multiple new packages such as Blob and Identity and really challenge my patient. I also deployed it for a limited time (due to free credits on Azure) with an sql database on Azure along with my webapp and storage account. The focus was on getting to learn ASP.NET Core, so the design has some flaws due to the time limitation. During the development I started out using a local database, SQL Server Database File, before I knew how to deploy and publish. There is much to be learned still but I hope you'll enjoy the site. Feel free to check it out live (while it's still active):
