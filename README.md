# BackOffice
A fullstack project with MVC designpattern in ASP.NET. My first time coding with ASP.NET, views and partial views. The design was given to me as an assignment, and the goal was to do as much as I could before a deadline and learning to work with more complex solutions. It was very challenging but fun to learn something that was so different from the front end development that I am used to with React and JavaScript/TypeScript. I got to experience how to use multiple new packages such as Blob and Identity and really challenge my patient. I also deployed it for a limited time with as sql database on Azure along with my webapp and storage account. 

## Tools & Techniques
- Asp.NET
- C#
- Razor Views
- Azure Storage Blob
- Identity
- SignalR

### Functions
The application is built in C# with ASP.NET MVC. I try to use partial views, viewmodels and place my files and my logic in the right places. Some functions in the application:
- Notifications with SignaR
- Authenitcation with Identity
- Blob file upload to Azure
- Middleware with default roles and admin user
- CRUD for projects (some for users and clients)
